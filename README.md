# Tableau-Data-Integration
Working with Relationships in Tableau

This repository aims to solve the problem of visualizing sellers in their respective geolocations, using a bubble chart to illustrate the total payments they have received from customers. The visualization leverages Tableau's powerful features, particularly the relationship feature, to establish connections between the seller data and the payment data.

-----------------
Problem Statement
-----------------
The challenge is to create an interactive and visually appealing visualization that showcases the geographical distribution of sellers and highlights the variation in the total payments they have received. By representing sellers as bubbles on a map, with each bubble's size indicating the amount of money received, viewers can easily grasp the distribution patterns and identify the top-performing sellers.
